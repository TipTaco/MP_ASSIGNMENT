Machine Perception Assignment for Curtin University COMP3007

The task for the assignment was to develop a machine perception pipeline that would be able to take in an image of a building sign around the Curtin University campus and return both the cropped region of the numbers, the directions and produce a text output file.

An example input file:

![Input file](./res/DS02.jpg?raw=True "Example building sign")

The example output cropped region (where the valid sign was located):
